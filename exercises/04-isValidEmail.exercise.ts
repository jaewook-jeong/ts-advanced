 *
 * This is what type predicates do - they let you specify your own logic
 * for resolving the type of something. When paired with an Opaque<> type
 * helper, it can let you be extremely confident of the shape of your code.

/**
 * 💡 We can also use an assertion function for the same check. That helps
 * colocate the error logic with the check itself. More info:
 *
 * https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#assertion-functions
 *
 * Let's try it:
 *
 * 🛠 Rename isValidEmail to assertsValidEmail.
 *
 * 🛠 Change the check in the function to remove the if statement, and instead
 * just call the function assertsValidEmail on values.email:
 *
 * assertsValidEmail(values.email);
 *
 * 🛠 Change the return type of assertsValidEmail to asserts email is ValidEmail
 *
 * const assertsValidEmail = (email: string): asserts email is ValidEmail => {
 *
 * ⛔️ Holy errors, Batman!
 *
 * Let's start with the one inside the assertsValidEmail function.
 *
 * Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'void'.
 *
 * Assertion functions can't return anything - they must return nothing. That
 * means we need to move the error logic inside our assertion function instead
 * of just returning a boolean.
 *
 * 🛠 Change the function body of assertsValidEmail to throw an error if the
 * email isn't valid:
 *
 * if (!email.includes("@")) {
 *   throw new Error("Invalid email");
 * }
 */

/**
 * ⛔️ OK, that helped a little. But there's still more out there.
 *
 * Assertions require every name in the call target to be declared with an
 * explicit type annotation.
 *
 * This is one of the ALL TIME WORST TS ERRORS out there. The fix is deeply
 * counter-intuitive. Assertion functions can't be declared as arrow functions.
 * So if we declare it as a function() {}, the error will go away.
 *
 * 🛠 Change assertsValidEmail from an arrow function to a traditional function:
 *
 * function assertsValidEmail(email: string): asserts email is ValidEmail {
 *
 * ✅ The errors are gone! The code inside onSubmit is now impressively concise.
 * We've moved the erroring logic into the assertion function. If we don't call
 * the assertion function, createUser will yell at us that we haven't checked
 * that the email is valid.
